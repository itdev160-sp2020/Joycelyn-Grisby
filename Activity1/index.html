        <h1>Traveling Toronto</h1>

        <p>There are so many awesome things I love about Toronto, Ontario. I first traveled to Toronto when I was 1 years old.<br />
            My parents first started traveling to Toronto in the late 1970's, <em>back when you didn't need a passport.</em> <br /> Growing we spent
            2 weeks there in the month of July every year. My father isn't big on planes, so we drove. It became a second home 
            and it still is. There is so much to do especially in the summer.<br /> Let's talk about some of my favorite thingsand places.</p>
